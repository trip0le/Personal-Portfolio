### Personal Portfolio

Made with React.js, the website has the following sections (routing of each section has been done using react router dom) :
- Home
- About
- Projects
- Contact (Once a user fills the contact form, an email of the form details will be sent to the portfolio owner - emailjs has been used to develop this feature).
